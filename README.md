# Robust_Statistics
In this project, I implemented robust linear regression methods. I used M-Estimation with a Tukey's Bisquared rho function. I also implemented S-Estimation. 

I tested these against classical linear regression and found that the robust versions preformed much better when the normal error term assumption is not met. 

In addition, I developed a method for mixed regression clustering based on the K-means clustering.
